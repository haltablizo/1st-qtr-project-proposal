Working Title: "Life: For Love and Coffee"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description: 
I will be making a website about my interests and hobbies, among other things,
as well as a place of my own where i can document or blog about my daily hectic
life as a pisay student. It would double as a safe space for me to share my 
thoughts, and it might even get a laugh from the audience. I could use web
pages to document my art portfolio, my gaming montage, and me crying to reqs.
(LOL) 

The title is just a combination of my interests (love) and cramming and late
night studying (coffee). Life is currently revolving like this for me, so i 
thought to make the best of it. :)
