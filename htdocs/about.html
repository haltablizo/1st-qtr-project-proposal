        <p id = "intro">Hello! I'm Hannah. The photo on the left was intentional and very much accurate :(. I like pretty things so I made my website as visually aesthetic as possible. I like music, and I usually listen to indie. One of my most listened artists are <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/4tuJ0bMpJh08umKkEXKUI5">Gracie Abrams</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/7LImGq5KnzQobZciDJpeJb">Charlotte Lawrence</a>, and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/7gXb99Sf9nNmpNYeAgIQFG"> Sub urban</a>. I also like games, and I mainly play Call of Duty: Mobile and Tetr.io. Of course, there should be a balance between games and studying. If I have the time and motivation, I try to study math, chem, physics, and cs because those are my favorite subjects. </p>
